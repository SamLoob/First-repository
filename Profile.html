            <h1>MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h1>
            <p>
                I born in Armenia, Quindio, then my family moved to Cali where I live now, my mum 
                is Diana Jojoa a accountant, my dad is Jorge Soto a mechanical enginner, when
                I was 4 years ago my family got me into soccer for 6 years followed by getting into 
                a musical academy and some courses extra outside the school.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only thing I got passionate about was music, I can play guitar, play piano 
                and play flute, but nothing of this is a good job because I want earn much money
                so I decided to study programming on my own.
